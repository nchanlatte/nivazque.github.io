          <p>
            I never thought that I would like using computers or learning how to code. I started because my brother told me I couldnt do it. So as a rebelious sister, I did.
            I decided to take an application development class to see what it was like. It was pure luck that I got into Creightons 400 level applications class.
            I was supposed to have taken some basic coding and database clasess before. I was the only student who went it with now knowledge. This made me more determined then ever to come out on top.
            In a semester I had a crash course on Java Script, HTML, Database and more. My partner and I built an application that allowed students to find rides back home during break or for a weekend adventure.
            We knew that our freshman year we had many troubles finding a ride home since we didnt know anyone. Our application allowed anyone with a Creighton ID to register and be either a rider or a driver.
            Each person had to select a state and then a city so that people could find perfect matches for cars. The application later drilled down to finding a match and then giving your contact information and how much luggage or space a person had available.
            It was an incredible expierence that really made me love coding and development. Which has made me contiue to use CodeAcadamy.com to further develop my skills. I also use my brother, who is a computer science major, to help me learn other coding languages like Python.

          <p>
           My freshman summer of college I journeyed to China to take on a new language and culture that I had never experienced.
           The class was called "Hunting for Tigers and Dragons" and to my disappointment none were spotted.
           The class allowed students to research the culture and history of China and more specifically how to do business in China.
           We stopped in Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou. We visited companies such as,Lenovo, Microsoft, an Orphanage, an Omaha Nursing home (on the rage in China!), and a tech company.
           Too say the least I had a major culture shock from living in Omaha Nebraska my whole life. The research did not prepare me for the beauty and liveliness of the country.
           It was an experience of a lifetime! The world is definitely a bit over populated. As soon as I arrived a was engulfed and shocked at the hustle and bustle of the city life.
           It wasn't like New York that is just skyscrapers and people running around, this was pure art. Shanghai was one of the most culturally split and diverse architecture and population I had seen.
           The boat ride allowed me to glimpse old shanghai, which is what i thought China was, to new shanghai!
           It compared modern architecture to cultural architecture.
