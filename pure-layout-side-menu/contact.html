My freshman summer of college I journeyed to China to take on a new language and culture that I had never experienced. The class was called "Hunting for Tigers and Dragons" and to my disappointment none were spotted. The class allowed students to research the culture and history of China and more specifically how to do business in China. We stopped in Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou. We visited companies such as,Lenovo, Microsoft, an Orphanage, an Omaha Nursing home (on the rage in China!), and a tech company.

Too say the least I had a major culture shock from living in Omaha Nebraska my whole life. The research did not prepare me for the beauty and liveliness of the country. It was an experience of a lifetime! The world is definitely a bit over populated.

As soon as I arrived a was engulfed and shocked at the hustle and bustle of the city life. It wasn't like New York that is just skyscrapers and people running around, this was pure art. Shanghai was one of the most culturally split and diverse architecture and population I had seen. The boat ride allowed me to glimpse old shanghai, which is what i thought China was, to new shanghai! It compared modern architecture to cultural architecture.
